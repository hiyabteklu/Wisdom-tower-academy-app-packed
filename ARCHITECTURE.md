# Wisdom Tower Academy — Architecture (Website + Android App)

> **Read this first**, together with `NATIVE_APP_BRIEF.md`. If the two ever disagree, `NATIVE_APP_BRIEF.md` (newer) wins for *what to build*; this file describes *how the existing shell works*.

## 1. Repositories

| Repo | Purpose | Live URL / Role |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| [hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy](https://github.com/hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy) | **Website** (source of truth for content, auth, packages, progress, flashcards, PDFs, free resources) | https://www.wisdom-tower-academy.live |
| [hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app-packed](https://github.com/hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app-packed) | **Android app (current)** — Compose screens beside the WebView shell | GitHub Actions → APK / AAB |
| [hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app](https://github.com/hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app) | Older WebView-only app (legacy) | Not the active project |

There is **no separate backend** for the app. Data comes from the website's API routes (and, for auth, the same Supabase project).

**One host only:** always use `https://www.wisdom-tower-academy.live`. localStorage (where the Supabase session lives) is per-origin, so mixing the bare domain, `www.` and `*.vercel.app` silently loses the login.

## 2. How the app works (WebView shell — still the fallback and the host for learning content)

```

> **Open question:** `NATIVE_APP_BRIEF.md` rule 7 says 4 tabs (Home / Learning / Packages / Account); the Sep-27 change log entry below added Settings as a 5th. Check `StructuralNav.kt` and decide; then fix whichever doc is wrong.

### Key behaviours

1. **Website is the source of truth**
2. **Native chrome owns the header + bottom nav** — fixed; website header/footer hidden via injected CSS
3. **Status bar is clean** — solid navy behind system icons; content padded with WindowInsets.statusBars
4. **Top-left menu** — Compact native Card with About, Contact us, FAQ, Privacy, Terms
5. **Notification bell** opens `https://www.wisdom-tower-academy.live/notifications` only (package / order status list — **not** Settings)
6. Visiting `/notifications` must **not** force bottom-nav tab to Home or Account
7. **Offline PDF vault** in private app storage
8. **FLAG_SECURE** on
9. **Back button** uses WebView history first
10. **Offline cache** — Static pages, assets, and PDFs remain vaulted; dynamic list APIs are not persisted
11. **Study Tool Overlay Layer** — Opening AI Tutor, Calculator, Notebook, Timer, or Planner never navigates the main WebView away. The underlying study page (notes, books, question bank, scroll position) remains fully loaded and alive. The tool runs in an independent overlay layer on top; tapping "Done", Close, or device Back dismisses the overlay and immediately reveals the exact study note intact.

---

## 3. Native Compose migration (in progress)

Native screens (Home, Packages, Learning landing, Account, Settings, Guides) are built beside the WebView shell, per `NATIVE_APP_BRIEF.md`. The WebView shell is **not** deleted: it stays as the fallback and as the host for books/PDFs, flashcards, notes, exams, question banks, AI tutor and checkout.

### Auth (how it really works today)

- The website stores its session in `localStorage['wt-academy-auth-v1']`. The app does **not** sign in by itself; `AuthStateManager` copies that value through a JS bridge.
- Known gaps (see `WEBSITE_CHANGES.md` and the Oct-11 review): the app never refreshes tokens, the website can create local-only fake sessions when Supabase login fails, and several API routes the app calls do not exist on the website.
- Target: native Supabase sign-in + token refresh + session handed to the WebView. Until then, treat native auth state as a mirror of the WebView, not as independent auth.

---

## 4. Developer quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app-packed.git
cd Wisdom-tower-academy-app-packed
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

- Main: `app/src/main/java/com/wisdomtower/academy/MainActivity.kt`
- Offline: `OfflineVault.kt`
- CI: see `.github/workflows/` (the **Build Production AAB & APK** action must stay green)

## 5. UI rules (do not regress)

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Status-bar area solid navy | Clean mobile look |
| Native top bar fixed | Must never disappear on scroll |
| Hamburger menu top-left | About / Contact / FAQ / etc. |
| Branding "Wisdom Tower Academy" | Correct name |
| Notification icon → `/notifications` only | Not Settings / Account |
| Bottom nav unaffected by `/notifications` | Keep current tab |
| Unified chrome palette | Status & top/bottom bars use deep navy `#060B15`, accent `#22E0FF`, card surface `#0C1424`, perfectly matching website surfaces and pill button language |

---

## 6. Flashcards

Live in website: `FlashcardViewer.tsx` + ui-polish `.fc-*` classes — 3D flip, distinct back colour, swipe animations.

---

## 7. Study Timer (Pomodoro Focus Timer)

- **Website is the primary control:** The web Focus timer (`PomodoroTimer.tsx` + `focus-timer` library) is the single source of truth and full control interface (presets, start/pause/reset, sound/nudges).
- **No separate floating player in content area:** The app must NEVER show a secondary permanent or floating music-player style widget over the WebView.
- **Top Bar Indicator:** While the timer is actively running (`isRunning && timerRemainingSeconds > 0`), the native top bar displays a compact, non-intrusive status pill cleanly positioned directly below the notification bell.
- **Reliable Stop & Clean Dismiss:** The top bar pill includes an inline close `(X)` button that immediately stops the timer in both the web layer (`wt-focus-timer` / `localStorage`) and native state, hiding the pill completely.
- **Process Death & Restart:** On app launch or after process death, if the timer is not actively running, no timer UI is shown.

## 8. Change log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-10-11 | Docs/config cleanup: single host `www.wisdom-tower-academy.live` (`.env.example` SITE_URL fixed), repo table and section 3 updated to match `NATIVE_APP_BRIEF.md`, auth reality documented. |
| 2026-10-05 | WebCacheVault v3 & Dynamic Content Reliability: (1) Bumped vault index to v3 (`web_index_v3.json`) with automated self-healing migration that purges dynamic list APIs and degraded empty shells. (2) Strictly isolated all dynamic list and catalog endpoints (Supabase, `/_next/data/`, `_rsc`, Next.js route payloads, `/api/`, `/graphql`) so online sessions always fetch fresh lists without disk caching. (3) Added `isDegradedOrEmptyHtml` guard to prevent vaulting 'Offline — open this hub once online to cache it' or error states during weak network sessions, keeping rich offline pages and PDFs intact. (4) Fixed weak network recovery by preventing premature offline page aborts in `checkRawErrors()` and `showOfflinePage()` when online, and increased mobile network timeouts. (5) Replaced blanket immutable caching with safe `no-cache, must-revalidate` headers for HTML/JSON, plus an automated one-time `clearCache(false)` on v3 first run so users never need to wipe app data for routine updates. |
| 2026-09-29 | Aggressive caching, lifecycle recovery & navigation fix: (1) Upgraded WebCacheVault to 6-thread concurrent worker pool, expanded CORE_HUBS with Grade 12 & Freshman hubs, enabled parallel pre-caching of all srcset and Next.js thumbnails on launch so internet bandwidth actively caches the site, and served all cached resources from disk online for 0ms loads. (2) Added onRenderProcessGone recovery in WebViewClient to prevent white/dead frozen state when switching back from heavy apps like TikTok. (3) Added lifecycle onResume/onPause webView timers handling and unconditional loadUrl in navigateTo so bottom navigation tabs reliably transition. (4) Scoped header hiding strictly to fixed site top bar and removed dragstart touch interceptors so hub cards open instantly. |
| 2026-09-29 | Fixed Study Timer: removed duplicate floating music-player style widget from WebView content area. Added compact status pill in the native top bar cleanly under the notification bell that only displays while actively running. Added reliable inline (X) stop control that updates web localStorage + events, and ensured timer indicator never awkwardly persists or reappears after app restart when stopped. |
| 2026-09-27 | Streamlined futuristic loader: purely circular design with a subtle translucent circular backing matching the spinner dimensions (removed card/box and text clutter), debounced auto-duration display that never triggers on text boxes, email/password inputs, flashcards, or fast-loaded pages, and immediately dismisses the instant content is ready |
| 2026-09-27 | Redesigned hamburger menu into a compact native Card Dialog (removed duplicated/bloated items: Settings, Account, Logout, Telegram; kept 5 essential links: About, Contact us, FAQ, Privacy, Terms), added Settings as 5th tab on bottom navigation (Home — Learning — Packages — Account — Settings), added anti-copy DOM protection, and clean in-place download progress update |
| 2026-09-26 | Fixed PDF size check & silent download: strictly prohibited probes from falling through to full GETs (unresolved probes return fabricated response without Content-Length), ensured vault writes occur ONLY on explicit user download actions, eliminated 'Ready' fallback in favor of 'Size unknown', and added single-flight cached UI state ('Already downloaded — opening…') |
| 2026-09-25 | Replaced bottom navigation with native Apple-quality tab bar (removed tacky gradients, capsule boxes, and dots; crisp icon/typography tinting, subtle ripple and haptic feedback) and fixed tab highlight accuracy across all /academy, /packages, /account routes and on app resume after inactivity |
| 2026-09-25 | Fixed book size check and silent download: pre-seeded book catalog sizes, hooked fetch probes with empty body + CORS expose headers, prevented premature vault writes on probes, and eliminated 'Ready' fallback |
| 2026-09-21 | Pinned Refresh + Notifications in end Row; added getPdfSize to AndroidOfflineVault and enhanced BOOK_PAGE_HELPERS_JS |
| 2026-09-17 | Notification bell → `/notifications` only; MainActivity shell restored; docs updated |
| 2026-09-16 | Fixed status-bar overlap; fixed top bar; hamburger menu; branding; notifications |
| 2026-09-16 | Website flashcard flip + swipe restored |
