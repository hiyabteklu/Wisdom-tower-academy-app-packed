/**
 * M3 (docs/UI_MOTION_PLAN.md): fade-through transition for the five bottom tabs (iOS tab bars dissolve, they do not slide).
 *
 * One layer per tab. The layer of the SELECTED tab fades in (210 ms, starts after 60 ms, rises 10 dp); the layer of the tab
 * that was just left stays composed for 90 ms and fades out, then it is removed exactly as before (no state is kept, so
 * behaviour is unchanged: only the swap is no longer a cut).
 *
 * - An opaque WisdomNavy backdrop stays behind the fading content, so the WebView underneath can never show through.
 * - [active] = false (the Learning tab while a hub page is open in the WebView) removes the layer at once, no fade.
 * - Everything animates through `graphicsLayer` (alpha, translationY) read in the draw phase: no recomposition per frame.
 * - The incoming layer is drawn on top (zIndex 11 vs 10), so it takes the touches from the first frame.
 * - Tab selection stays owned by `selectedIndex` in MainActivity; this file never changes it.
