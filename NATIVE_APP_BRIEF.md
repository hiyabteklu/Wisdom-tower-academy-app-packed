## 1. What we are doing (one paragraph)

The **Wisdom Tower Academy website is the source of truth**. The Android app currently wraps the website in a WebView, so every tab switch looks like a page reload ("blinking"). We are turning the app into a **mostly native Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)** that **looks and is structured like the website** (same layouts, arrangement, images, colors, wording), uses the **same data** (same Supabase project, same authors, same content), and only hands off to the website for the heavy, server-based parts.

## 2. Repositories

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| `hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy` | The website (Next.js on Vercel). Source of truth. **Never edit it from this project.** |
| `hiyabteklu/Wisdom-tower-academy-app-packed` | This Android app. Branch `main`. |
| `website-reference/` (inside this repo) | Read-only snapshot of the website code, made by GitHub Action **"Sync website reference"** (Actions → Sync website reference → Run workflow). Re-run it when the website changes. It skips env files, Firebase config, keystores, lockfiles, PDFs, zips, videos and files over 1 MB. |

The coding agent (Google AI Studio or any other) can see only ONE repo, which is why the website snapshot lives here. `website-reference/` is excluded from the app build.

## 3. Website stack (do not blind yourself to these)

- **Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind**, hosted on **Vercel**, code on GitHub
- **Supabase**: login/auth and the main database
- **Appwrite**: file storage only
- **Firebase**: push notifications (FCM)
- **Google Gemini**: the AI tutor
- **Groq**: the **"Explain with AI"** buttons on every question-bank and exam question
- All secret API keys live in **Vercel environment variables** and are NOT in the repos. **Never put an API key in the Android app.** Anything that needs a secret key must call the website's API routes (`website-reference/src/app/api/`).

## 4. What is native and what stays on the website

**Native (build these in Compose, mimic the website):**
- App shell: top bar, bottom navigation, menu, notifications list
- Home, Academy/Packages hubs, program/package landing pages, Learning landing, Account, Settings
- Static/guide pages (Success Stories, Study Techniques, Campus Life, Universities, Departments, Scholarships) when their data is not server-gated
- Cards, thumbnails, images, headers, empty/loading states

**Stays on the website (open from a native screen in the existing WebView host):**
- Books/PDF reading, flashcards, notes, exams, question banks, "Explain with AI"
- Progress tracker and analytics
- AI tutor and any other server-based feature
- Checkout, orders, admin

Rule of thumb: if the screen only arranges items and shows images/titles, build it native. If it needs the learning material itself, a server calculation or a secret key, open the website.

## 5. Hard rules

1. **Read before you build.** For every screen, open the website's page file, every component it imports, the CSS it uses and the data files behind it in `website-reference/`. Look at the images in `website-reference/public/images/`. Do not guess the design.
2. **Mimic the website**: same section order, same grid (e.g. 2 columns on mobile), same card structure, same colors, same fonts, same icons (lucide icons have Material equivalents; match as closely as possible), same wording.
3. **Respect `hide-on-app`.** The website marks sections with the CSS class `hide-on-app` when they should NOT appear in the app. Do not build those.
4. **Use the website's real assets and text.** Copy images from `website-reference/public/images/...` into the Android project. Never invent images, copy or numbers. If an asset is missing from the snapshot (e.g. over 1 MB), say so and ask; do not substitute.
5. **No duplicated content in the app.** Any content shown from data must come from the same Supabase/Appwrite source as the website (Phase B). Where Phase A needs placeholders, put them in ONE clearly marked seed file with a comment naming the website source file.
6. **No blinking.** Native screens must keep state between tab switches (`rememberSaveable`, a ViewModel per tab, `saveState/restoreState` on navigation). Any WebView host must stay alive between tabs and must not call `loadUrl` for a page it is already showing.
7. **Keep the app's existing rules** from `ARCHITECTURE.md`: navy status bar (no overlap with clock/battery), fixed top bar (menu · "Wisdom Tower Academy" · notifications), notification bell opens `/notifications` only, bottom nav Home / Learning / Packages / Account, offline PDF vault, `FLAG_SECURE`.
8. **Don't delete the WebView shell.** Build the native screens beside it and switch screen by screen, so the app always builds and can fall back.
9. **Never commit secrets** (env files, `google-services.json`, keystores, API keys).
10. **Never edit `website-reference/`.** If the website needs a change, write it in `WEBSITE_CHANGES.md` (file path, exact code, reason).
11. **Small commits**, one screen per commit, clear messages. After each commit, say what could affect tab-switch speed.
12. The **Build Production AAB & APK** GitHub Action must stay green.
13. **Read docs/BUILD_PITFALLS.md before writing code and never repeat a listed mistake.**
14. **Never put a secret or server key in the Android app.** Anything that needs a secret key (Explain with AI, SMS/email, push sending, admin) must call the website API routes in `website-reference/src/app/api/` or open the website.
15. **Only the 6 public keys above may exist in the app.** Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID` may exist in `.env.example` and BuildConfig. Every key must have a non-empty value so no BuildConfig field is empty. Signing keys exist strictly as GitHub Actions secrets read via `System.getenv`.

## 6. Known facts about the website Home page (already analysed)

Source: `website-reference/src/app/page.tsx` → `src/components/home/LandingPage.tsx` + `LandingPathways.tsx`.

**Shown in the app (in this order):**
1. **Hero**: dark gradient background with soft glowing orbs; big heading "Wisdom **Tower** Academy" (middle word is an animated gradient accent); button row: primary "Enter Academy →" (`/academy`) and a second button that depends on login: signed in → "My Learning" (`/learning`), signed out → "Sign in" (`/login`, amber outline); under it a line: signed in → "Welcome back, {name} · Continue where you left off", signed out → "New here? Create a free account".
2. **Welcome image card** (`/images/home/academy.jpg`), full width, 16:9 on phones, rounded, gradient overlay, floating pill "Open Learning →" bottom-right, taps to `/learning`.
3. **Program cards grid**, 2 columns on mobile, 16:10 image on top, below it a single row: program name left + small "Open →" button right. Cards in order: ECE Engineering, Freshman, Grade 9–12, COC, UAT, GAT, Exit Exam, Remedial (images from `src/data/packages` and `/images/special-packages/ece.jpg`).
4. **"Other resources"** heading, then a 2-column grid of compact cards (icon tile + title + small arrow): Success Stories, Study Techniques, Campus Life, Universities Directory, Departments Guide, Scholarships Guide, each with its own accent color.

**Hidden in the app (`hide-on-app`):** stats slider, infinity card, "Want digital services instead?", final CTA, partnership path.

**Design tokens:** Tailwind colors `wisdom-dark`, `wisdom-navy`, `wisdom-card`, `wisdom-muted` come from CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` (read the exact values there); `wisdom-cyan #22e0ff`, `cyan-dark #00c4e6`. Fonts come from `--font-display` and `--font-body` set in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Button and card styles (`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-open`, `card-modern`) are defined in `globals.css` / `ui-polish.css`. Read these files and port the exact values into a Compose theme.

## 7. Roadmap

**Step 0 — Safety.** Make sure the current app builds. Don't remove the WebView shell. (Optional: the old tab-reload regression was probably introduced around commit `9f6e59f` — cache v4 purge — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`; keeping each tab's WebView alive is the fallback fix.)

**Phase A — Native UI, no server data (current).**
- A0. Write `docs/WEBSITE_ANALYSIS.md`: for every website route that appears in the app, list the page file, components, CSS, data files, images, colors, what is `hide-on-app`, and whether it is native or website-handoff.
- A1. Compose theme (colors, typography, shapes, buttons, cards) ported from the website CSS.
- A2. Native **Home** screen exactly as in section 6.
- A3. Native **Academy / Packages** hub and package landing pages.
- A4. Native **Learning** landing (shell only; the learning material opens from the website).
- A5. Native **Account** and **Settings** shells.
- A6. Native static guide pages (only if not server-gated).
- Stop at every screen for the owner's review.

**Phase B — Real data.** Sign in with the same Supabase project (shared session with the WebView so users log in once), read packages, courses, authors and notifications from the same tables (check row-level security), load thumbnails from Appwrite storage. No new tables, no copied content.

**Phase C — Handoffs.** Open books/PDFs, flashcards, notes, exams, question banks, progress tracker and AI tutor on the website from native screens with the logged-in session.
