# Instructions for Claude agents

**DAY / NIGHT MODE IS CANCELLED (owner order 2026-10-17, newest decision; it OVERRIDES `docs/DAY_NIGHT_PLAN.md`, ignore slices L1 to L9).** The app uses many transparent glass cards, so a light page does not work. The app is night-only: `AppThemeMode.isDark` is always true, and the light branches in Color.kt, WisdomGlass.kt, WisdomFieldTokens.kt, WisdomMessageCard.kt and Theme.kt are dead code (do not bring them back and do not build a day switch). The student only picks a BACKGROUND (Settings > Display & Theme): Dark, BG 1, BG 2, BG 3 (the pictures `app/src/main/assets/backgrounds/bg_1.png` to `bg_3.png`), Blue. Code: `ui/theme/AppBackground.kt`. Still use `WisdomInk`, `WisdomOnInk`, `WisdomTextPrimary`, `WisdomMuted` instead of `Color.White` / `Color.Black` for text and tints.

**PLAY STORE PREPARATION (owner order 2026-10-17, the current priority): read `docs/PLAY_STORE_UI_PLAN.md` (release risks and UI slices S0 to S10, status table in its section 3). One slice per chat; the owner says "do S<n>", otherwise do the next open slice. First make sure the patch `scripts/patch_ux_consistency_fixes.py` was run and merged (see the plan, section 1).**

**FIRST, OWNER RULE 2026-10-16: read `docs/OWNER_RULE_WRITTEN_IS_DONE.md`. Written and pushed code counts as DONE (builds are green, the owner has confirmed it works). It overrides every `[~]`, "CI NOT seen" and "not seen on a device" label in the older docs. Report only what is genuinely not done.**

**UI MOTION (owner order 2026-10-16, third live task): read `docs/UI_MOTION_PLAN.md` (root causes, motion language, area inventory, slices M1 to M11, status table in its section 7). It overrides the "do not work on UI polishing" lines below for MOTION AND TRANSITIONS ONLY (bottom nav pill, tab and screen transitions, card entrance, Settings accordions and the rest of the plan). Everything else archived stays closed. One slice per chat; the owner says "do M<n>", otherwise do the next open slice.**

The agent rules live in ONE place: **`HANDOFF.md` section 0 (MANDATORY AGENT PROTOCOL)**. Read `HANDOFF.md` in full first, then **`docs/COMPETITION_STATUS.md`** (the live stage board), `docs/COMPETITION_DECISIONS.md` (owner answers, they override the plan), `docs/COMPETITION_PLAN.md`, then `docs/BUILD_PITFALLS.md` before writing any code, and the newest `docs/SESSION_*.md` files. Section 0, rule 10, plus `docs/EDITING_LARGE_FILES.md`, explain how to change files that are too big to resend: patch script plus the GitHub Action; NEVER answer "the file is too big".

**NOTIFICATIONS V2 (owner order 2026-10-15, live work, extends C8): read `docs/NOTIFICATIONS_V2_PLAN.md` (plan, verified facts, slices R0 to R8, progress table in its section 8) right after the status board. It spans this repo, the WEBSITE repo and the live Supabase project.**

**ADMIN CONSOLE (owner orders 2026-10-15 and 2026-10-16): `docs/ADMIN_MOBILE_PLAN.md` and `docs/ADMIN_UI_V2_PLAN.md`. Code is in the WEBSITE repo.**

**FREE-QUOTA RULE (owner is on a free plan and rotates between ~8 accounts; unpushed work is lost): read `docs/AGENT_QUOTA_PROTOCOL.md`. Do ONE small slice, push it in ONE commit with the stage board and a session log, then tell the owner what is next. Do not chain many stages in one chat.**

Current phase (2026-10-14): **the competition space is the ONLY live work** (trophy replaces Refresh, global timed exams, countdown, native runner, leaderboard). The owner ordered the stages C1 to C10 to be executed one at a time, in order. UI polishing T1 to T9 and everything older is archived (`docs/archive/README.md`): do not work on it. The global constraints G1 to G9 in `docs/UI_POLISH_TASKS.md` (forbidden files, no invented text, no new dependencies or hosts) stay in force. For every stage: inspect the code first, make focused changes, keep the approved design, and avoid regressions.

Before you stop (or when your quota is nearly out), write the session log first (`docs/COMPETITION_STATUS.md` session log and a `docs/SESSION_*.md` file).

The repo is public: never commit secrets or personal data. The owner is not a coder: explain in plain language, short, answer first; ask in plain words when you are stuck.
